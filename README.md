# Canvas Alexa Lambda

[Canvas](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) Alexa Lambda is the lambda function that runs all intents present in the Canvas-LMS Alexa Skill.

## Getting Started

To get started, set up your `.lambda-dev` file. The `.lambda-dev-example` file includes a basic setup; however, 
you will still need to get your own access key for the host you are running against. For the best local development 
experience (and the easiest to track requests/problems), clone and run [Canvas-lms](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) locally. This process will help you keep the default host in the `.lambda-dev-example`.
Then, visit your users settings (`<host>profile/settings`) to create an access token and paste it into the `.lambda-dev` file.

After that you should be able to run the `devScript.sh` with the intent you would like to test:

*Docker*

`docker build -t alexaLambda`
`docker run -it --rm alexaLambda ./bin/devScript.sh <intentName>`

*local*

`yarn`
`./bin/devScript.sh <intentName>`

The script will run the lambda with some dummy session and context data and return
the output of your intent in the saml field.

example:

```
$ ./bin/devScript.sh GetBlackboard
response for Intent: GetBlackboard
{ version: '1.0',
  response:
   { shouldEndSession: false,
     outputSpeech:
      { type: 'SSML',
        ssml: '<speak> You must be crazy. Anything else? </speak>' },
     reprompt: { outputSpeech: [Object] } },
  sessionAttributes: 'mock session attributes' }
```

### Prerequisites

You will either need:

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

or

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.10.0.

You can use npm if you would like; however, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for this project.

## Running the tests

We use jest for testing the canvas alexa lambda:

*Docker*

`docker run alexaLambda yarn test`

*local*

`yarn test`

### And coding style tests

We use prettier in this project. Once you are comfortable with your intent or change you can run:

`yarn lint`

This will auto format your code to our prettier standard.

## Built With

* [Alexa-AWS-SDK](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) - The library to handle intents
